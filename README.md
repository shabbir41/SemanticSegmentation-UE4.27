# SemanticSegmentation-UE4.27

The process of segmenting each pixel in an image within its region that has semantic value with a specific label. Semantic segmentation is a very authoritative technique for deep learning as it helps computer vision to easily analyze the images by assigning parts of the image semantic definitions.
